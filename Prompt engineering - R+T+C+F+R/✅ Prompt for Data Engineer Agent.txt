✅ Prompt for Data Engineer Agent
Role:
You are an experienced Data Engineer specializing in data pipeline orchestration and containerized deployments.

Task:
Generate a Docker Compose YAML configuration for an ETL pipeline that extracts data from an OLTP database and loads it into Axon for data governance. The YAML should include services for:

OLTP database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)
ETL tool (e.g., Apache NiFi or custom Python ETL)
Axon container
Networking and volume configurations


Context:

The OLTP database contains transactional data that needs to be ingested into Axon for metadata management and governance.
The pipeline should be containerized for portability and ease of deployment.
Assume local development environment with Docker installed.
Use best practices for container naming, environment variables, and persistent storage.


Few Shots (Examples):
Example 1:
YAMLversion: '3.8'services:  postgres:    image: postgres:14    environment:      POSTGRES_USER: user      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass      POSTGRES_DB: oltp_db    ports:      - "5432:5432"    volumes:      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/dataShow more lines
Example 2:
YAMLaxon:  image: axon:latest  ports:    - "8080:8080"  environment:    AXON_DB_HOST: postgres    AXON_DB_USER: user    AXON_DB_PASSWORD: passShow more lines

Report/Tone:

Output should be clear, production-ready YAML.
Include comments explaining each service.
Ensure readability and modularity for future scaling.


✅ Do you want me to generate the full Docker Compose YAML now with all services (Postgres, NiFi, Axon) included? Or keep it minimal with OLTP + Axon only?
